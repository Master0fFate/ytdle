# How to use/compile to exe?
> ffmpeg is required so if you want to run it as a python script, additionally to other requirements you have to have ffmpeg either as a system PATH or an .exe in the same directory.
If using pyinstaller/auto-py-to-exe make sure to include ffmpeg.exe as an additional file, no code changes necessary.
